    "It is your job to simulate a flight-checkin counter. There are m agents handling n passengers. The passengers arrive in line with in-between time given by an exponential distribution for INTER_ARRIVAL_TIME. Each passenger, once he or she gets to a counter, is processed in a time drawn from an exponential distribution with PROCESSING_TIME. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, in the usual case of 3-4 agents and 200+ customers on a flight, the customer waits much longer. We have been hired by the airlines customer-relations group to see how many extra agents must we hire to reduce waiting times by how much.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by representing each customer by a co-routine, which starts with the `inline` event. The state changes to the `atcounter` event, and then `ptime` seconds later, to the `leaves` event. Notice how this customer \"process\" is stopped at the yield, until the customer can be handled."
