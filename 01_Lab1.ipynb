    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using python3.5. If you havent installed Anaconda ever before, the easiest thing will be to grab the python3.5 installers from https://www.continuum.io/downloads .\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed Python 2.7.x from Anaconda before, the simplest thing to do that I found was here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30492623/using-both-python-2-x-and-python-3-x-in-ipython-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line creates a new `py35` envorinment, similar to a virtualenv. The second one activates it on the terminal, changing the PATH. The next two install the python3 kernel, so that you can continue using the ipython notebook the way you always did (a refresh, or maybe a restart would suffice, and it does not matter if the notebook is created with python 2.7 or python 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C\n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux you will need to do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`apt-get install gcc gcc-devel gdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "On Mac you will need to use brew. Install it from here: http://brew.sh/ . Then do \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "brew install gcc\n",
    "brew install gdb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed Xcode and have gcc and gdb installed (this would be an older version, perhaps `llvm-gcc`) thats fine too, so you might want to test and see if this works for you. If you want to use llvm thats fine too: just make sure everything is properly installed (`clang` and `lldb`). Still I'd recommend the brew way\n",
    "\n",
    "For windows, if you know how to use visual studio and C on it, thats great. Another option is msys2. http://msys2.github.io/ . Follow the instructions there and use `pacman` to make sure the gcc and gdb packages are installed. Then run the below to make sure you can compile."
